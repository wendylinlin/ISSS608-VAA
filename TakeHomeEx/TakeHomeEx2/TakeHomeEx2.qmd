```{r loadLibraries}
  pacman::p_load(jsonlite,tidygraph, ggraph, visNetwork, tidyverse)
```

If we already have jsonlite, we don't need it anymore
```{r loadData}
  MC1<- jsonlite::fromJSON("data/MC1.json")
```

After checking MC1, the data is a list and it's not a proper structure known by igraph, telegraph etc. We need to pull out the nodes and links out from the MC1.
We picked the desired fields and reorganized the columns using select function.
```{r }
  MC1_nodes <- as.tibble(MC1$nodes) %>% 
  select(id, type, country) 

  MC1_edges <- as.tibble(MC1$links) %>% 
  select (source, target, type, weight, key)
  
```

```{r}
  MC2<- fromJSON("data/mc2_challenge_graph.json")
```
