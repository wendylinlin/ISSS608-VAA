# **The demographic and financial characteristics for the city of Engagement**

## 1. Background

City of Engagement, with a **total population of 50,000**, is a **small city** located at Country of Nowhere. The city serves as a **service centre of an agriculture region** surrounding the city. The main agriculture of the region is fruit farms and vineyards. The local council of the city is in the process of preparing the Local Plan 2023. A sample survey of 1000 representative residents had been conducted to collect data **related to their household demographic and spending patterns,** among other things. The city aims to use the data to assist with their major community revitalization efforts, including how to **allocate a very large city renewal grant they have recently received.**

Here we will use static and interactive data analytics to help to reveal any data patterns found.

## 2. Load, understand and clean data

### 2.1. load related R packages and Load data:

Package used:

-   **`tidyverse`**: tidyverse is a collection of R packages that work together to provide a consistent and efficient way to work with data.

    -   It includes packages such as **dplyr** for data manipulation, **tidyr** for data tidying, and **ggplot2** for data visualization. Tidyverse emphasizes a "tidy data" philosophy, which involves organizing data in a standardized format that facilitates analysis and visualization.

-   **`plotly`**: plotly, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.

-   **`gganimate`**:, an ggplot extension for creating animated statistical graphs.

-   **`ggstatsplot`**: ggstatsplot is an R package that combines ggplot2 visualizations with statistical tests. It offers a set of functions that can be used to produce plots with accompanying statistical results. The package aims to simplify the process of creating complex visualizations while providing informative statistical output.

-   **`raincloudplots`:** This package is tailored towards easy visualization of grouped and repeated measures data. Moreover, it also provides individually linked repeated measures visualizations, which add detail and richness to a multitude of within-subject designs.

-   **`lubridate`:** lubridate is an R package that provides a set of tools for working with dates and times in R. It makes it easy to parse and manipulate date-time data, and provides functions to extract various components of date-time objects such as year, month, day, hour, minute, and second

-   **`ggiraph`:**: for making ‘ggplot’ graphics interactive.

```{r loadlibrary}
    #| warning: false
    #| echo: false
  pacman::p_load(tidyverse,dplyr, ggplot2, plotly,gganimate,ggstatsplot, ggdist, patchwork, gt, ggridges, lubridate, ggiraph) 
```

Load data from data files then inspect the data format

```{r loaddata}
  #| echo: false
  #import data from csv file and check the format
  Participants <- read_csv("data/Participants.csv")
  head(Participants)
  FinancialJournal <- read_csv("data/FinancialJournal.csv")
  head(FinancialJournal)
```

### 2.2 Compare loaded data with data source metadata

We have 2 data sources: Participants.csv and FinancialJournal.csv and below are what we know about them:

-   Participants.csv Contains information about the residents of City of Engagement that have agreed to participate in this study.

    -   participantId (integer): unique ID assigned to each participant.

    -   householdSize (integer): the number of people in the participant's household

    -   haveKids (boolean): whether there are children living in the participant's household.

    -   age (integer): participant's age in years at the start of the study.

    -   educationLevel (string factor): the participant's education level, one of: {"Low", "HighSchoolOrCollege", "Bachelors", "Graduate"} [(use tidyverse to convert to factor with fix sequence)]{.underline}

    -   interestGroup (char): a char representing the participant's stated primary interest group, one of {"A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J"}. Note: specific topics of interest have been redacted to avoid bias.

    -   joviality (float): a value ranging from \[0,1\] indicating the participant's overall happiness level at the start of the study. **0 is very unhappy and 1 is very happy.**

-   FinancialJournal.csv Contains information about financial transactions.

    -   participantId (integer): unique ID corresponding to the participant affected

    -   timestamp (datetime): the time when the check-in was logged.

    -   category (string factor): a string describing the expense category, one of {"Education", "Food", "Recreation", "RentAdjustment", "Shelter", "Wage"}

    -   amount (double): the amount of the transaction

### 2.3 Converting data to desired format using tidyverse according to meta data:

With the initial loaded data, some format is different from what is described in meta data. e.g. householdSize, joviality,amount are <dbl>. So convert them to the desired format using code below.

Convert categorical data with fixed sequence as factor, such as education level, financial journal category etc.

```{r formatparticipant}
  #| code-fold: true
  #| code-summary: "Show code"

  # convert for all Participants columns:
  # convert participantId to integer
  Participants$participantId <- as.integer(Participants$participantId)
  # convert householdSize to integer
  Participants$householdSize <- as.integer(Participants$householdSize)
  # convert haveKids to boolean
  Participants$haveKids <- as.logical(Participants$haveKids)
  # convert age to integer
  Participants$age <- as.integer(Participants$age)
  # convert educationLevel to factor with fixed sequence, define by levels
  Participants$educationLevel <- factor(Participants$educationLevel, levels = c("Low", "HighSchoolOrCollege", "Bachelors", "Graduate"))
  # convert interestGroup to character
  Participants$interestGroup <- as.character(Participants$interestGroup)
  # convert joviality to numeric
  Participants$joviality <- as.numeric(Participants$joviality)
  
```

```{r formatFinancialJournal}
 #| code-fold: true
 #| code-summary: "Show code"
  
  # convert participantId to integer
  FinancialJournal$participantId <- as.integer(FinancialJournal$participantId)
  # Convert timestamp column to POSIXct format
  FinancialJournal$timestamp <- as.POSIXct(FinancialJournal$timestamp)
  # convert category to factor with fixed sequence
  FinancialJournal$category <- factor(FinancialJournal$category, levels = c("Education", "Food", "Recreation", "RentAdjustment", "Shelter", "Wage"))
  # convert amount to numeric
  FinancialJournal$amount <- as.numeric(FinancialJournal$amount)
  # Format timestamp to only keep date information
  FinancialJournal$date <- as.Date(FinancialJournal$timestamp)
  FinancialJournal$year <- year(FinancialJournal$date)
  FinancialJournal$month <- month(FinancialJournal$date)

```

### 2.4 checking data quality

Check for missing values in Participants.csv, from the output value we know there's no missing data.

```{r dataquality}
  #| warning: false
  any(is.na(Participants))
  #do a summary of Participants:
  summary(Participants)
  
  #Remove duplicate rows based on all columns:
  Participants %>% distinct()

```

From the output, we can confirm there's no missing or duplicate data in Participants dataset. And data distribution is all according to described in meta data.

Do the same checkings for FinancialJournal

```{r}
  #| warning: false
  # Check for missing values in FinancialJournal.csv
  any(is.na(FinancialJournal))
  # Check timestamp range
  summary(FinancialJournal)
```

There's no missing data in FinancialJournal dataset. But there seems some duplicate records in FinancialJournal. Proceed to remove duplicates using distinct() function:

```{r}
  #display duplicate count for each row
  #FinancialJournal %>%
  #add_count(participantId,timestamp, category, amount) %>%
  #filter(n>1) %>%
  #distinct()

  FinancialJournal %>% distinct()

```

## 3.Exploratory Data Analysis

Plotting of diagrams in this exercise is mainly based on Grammar of Graphics, using the following layering concept:

![](https://r4va.netlify.app/chap01/img/image4.jpg){fig-align="center" width="404"}

-   **Data**: The dataset being plotted.

-   **Aesthetics** take attributes of the data and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colours, size, shape, or transparency.

-   **Geometrics**: The visual elements used for our data, such as point, bar or line.

-   **Facets** split the data into subsets to create multiple variations of the same graph (paneling, multiple plots).

-   **Statistics**, statiscal transformations that summarise data (e.g. mean, confidence intervals).

-   **Coordinate systems** define the plane on which data are mapped on the graphic.

-   **Themes** modify all non-data components of a plot, such as main title, sub-title, y-aixs title, or legend background.

### 3.1 About the population

We first want to understand how is the overall happiness level - Joviality distributed. By plotting Joviality with histogram we know how is the distribution of Joviality spread among the participants. Detailed example for usage of layering concept:

-   **Data**: Use Participant data, focus on Joviality score

-   **Aesthetics** In terms of Joviality scores, we explore how are people's joviality level spread between 0 to 1.

-   **Geometrics**: Choose to use histogram, Use 10 bins so the step is 0.1 per bin and we know the count in each value range. To view the count of bin, fill the bins with different gradient of blue based on the count (light blue to dark blue). It is achieved by setting the fill argument to the count variable and using the scale_fill_gradient function to create a gradient color scale.

    -   Using labs() function, x and y arguments are used to set the x and y axis labels respectively, title argument is used to set the plot title, and caption argument is used to add the label below the plot to explain value of joviality.

-   **Statistics**, Using stat_bin to allow statistics value of count value to be displayed on top of each bins, so value is visible.

-   **Coordinate systems**: Adjusting the display by setting x and y axis range and steps with the Joviality data range and count value range

-   **Themes**: use theme minimal

```{r JovialityHistogram}
    #| warning: false

    ggplot(data=Participants, aes(x = joviality, fill = after_stat(count))) +
    geom_histogram(bins=10, color="grey") +
    scale_fill_gradient(low="lightblue", high="darkblue") +
    ggtitle("Distribution of Joviality scores") +
    labs(x = "Joviality", y = "Frequency of participants in range", title = "Distribution of Joviality scores", caption = "0: very unhappy, 1: very happy") +
    stat_bin(bins=10,aes(label=after_stat(count)), geom="text", vjust=-0.5) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.1)) +
    scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 150))+
    theme_minimal()

```

#### 3.1.1 About factors affecting joviality level

Next we explore if there's any difference between different categorical attributes (Household Size, Education level, have Kids, Interest Group etc) with their Joviality value using violin chart.

```{r factorsAffectingJoviality}
  #| code-fold: true

                                  label = "Household Size"),
                             list(method = "update",

                                  label = "Interest Group")
                            
                        
                             )
                           )

  labs(
    title = "CI of mean joviality score with different interest Group",
    subtitle = "Gradient + interval plot")
  
```

**Data insights**

By visually inspect the data, with different categories may have different median value for joviality. By looking at mean/median value together, it looks like:

-   people with Graduate education level has highest joviality
-   Household with size of 3 has highest joviality
-   People has kids has higher joviality than people without kids
-   People with interest group ECG has higher joviality than others

To test our hypothesis above, we will do some statistical test. The null hypothesis will be the characterists displayed between different sample based on different category is only because of sampling randomness. For hasKids, it's True or False, we will use T test. For other categorical values such as educationLevel,householdSize,interestGroup, they have 2 or more than 2 categories, we will use ANOVA test. The data doesn't look as normally distributed based on violin chart, hence we use Kruskal - Wallis test. The Kruskal-Wallis test is a non-parametric test, which does not assume that the data is normally distributed or that the variances are equal. It tests whether there is a significant difference in medians of the groups.

```{r statsTest}
  #| warning: false

  #Two sample mean test for HasKids
  ggbetweenstats(
    data = Participants,
    x = haveKids, 
    y = joviality,
    type = "np",
    messages = FALSE
  )

  #Oneway ANOVA Test with ggbetweenstats() method for education
  ggbetweenstats(data = Participants, x = educationLevel, y = joviality,
                 xlab = "Education Level", ylab = "Joviality Value",
                 type = "np", pairwise.comparisons = TRUE, pairwise.display = "s", 
                 mean.ci = TRUE, p.adjust.method = "fdr",  conf.level = 0.95,
                 title = "Comparison of Median Joviality across different Education Level",
                 package = "ggthemes", palette = "Tableau_10") +
   scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1.5))
  
  #Oneway ANOVA Test with ggbetweenstats() method for education
  ggbetweenstats(data = Participants, x = householdSize, y = joviality,
                 xlab = "Education Level", ylab = "Joviality Value",
                 type = "np", pairwise.comparisons = TRUE, pairwise.display = "s", 
                 mean.ci = TRUE, p.adjust.method = "fdr",  conf.level = 0.95,
                 title = "Comparison of Median Joviality across different household Size",
                 package = "ggthemes", palette = "Tableau_10") +
   scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1.5))
  
  #Oneway ANOVA Test with ggbetweenstats() method for education
  ggbetweenstats(data = Participants, x = interestGroup, y = joviality,
                 xlab = "Education Level", ylab = "Joviality Value",
                 type = "np", pairwise.comparisons = TRUE, pairwise.display = "s", 
                 mean.ci = TRUE, p.adjust.method = "fdr",  conf.level = 0.95,
                 title = "Comparison of Median Joviality across different interest Group",
                 package = "ggthemes", palette = "Tableau_10") +
   scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 1.5))

  
```

From above statistical tests, p values are all quite big. None of them is less than 0.05 and able to reject null hypothesis. So we accept null hypothesis as the differences are due to sample randomness. there's no specific category of factor that significately affects the joviality value.

#### 3.1.2 About factor influencing have kids

Next, we count how many Unique Participants are there in the population? And among the Participants, how many have/do not have kids?

```{r}
  
  #library(dplyr)

  # count the number of unique participant IDs
  TotalParticipantCount <- Participants %>%
    distinct(participantId) %>%
    count()
  TotalParticipantCount

  
  # count the number of Participants with and without kids
Participants %>%
  group_by(haveKids) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(percent = count / sum(count) * 100) %>%
  mutate(haveKids = ifelse(haveKids, "Yes", "No")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = haveKids, y = count, fill = haveKids)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(x = "Have Kids?", y = "Participants Count", title = "Distribution of Participants with/without kids",subtitle = paste0("Total Participants: ", TotalParticipantCount$n)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(count, " (", round(percent, 2), "%)")), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +
  ggtitle("Number of Participants with and without kids") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#999999", "#78C850"), labels = c("False", "True")) +
  theme_minimal()


```

So what are the factors that may affect having kids? There might be some relationship between categorical data, we will look at the data to understand if education level affects having kids, we can perform a chi-squared test for independence. This test will help us determine if there is a significant association between the two categorical variables (education level and have kids). The output of the chi-squared test will give us a p-value. If the p-value is less than the significance level (usually 0.05), we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant association between education level and having kids. The null hypothesis in this test is that the two variables are independent, meaning that there is no association between them. the contingency table shows the frequency count of Participants' education level and whether they have kids or not. The chi-squared test has been performed to determine whether there is a significant association between education level and having kids.

```{r}
  # create contingency table
  cont_table <- table(Participants$educationLevel, Participants$haveKids)
  
  # perform chi-squared test
  chi_test <- chisq.test(cont_table)
  
  # display contingency table
  cont_table
  
  # display chi-squared test results
  cat("Chi-squared test results:")
  chi_test
```

The result shows that the chi-squared statistic is 12.481 with 3 degrees of freedom, and the p-value is 0.005905. The p-value is less than the conventional alpha level of 0.05, which means that we reject the null hypothesis of independence and conclude that there is a significant association between education level and having kids.

As for the best visualization to plot, we can use a stacked bar chart to show the proportion of participants with and without kids for each education level.

```{r}
  absCount <- ggplot(Participants, aes(x = educationLevel, fill = haveKids)) +
  geom_bar(position = "stack") +
  labs(title = "Education level vs. Having kids", x = "Education level", y = "Count", fill = "Have kids")

  catPercentage <- Participants %>%
  group_by(educationLevel, haveKids) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(percent = count / sum(count) * 100) %>%
  mutate(haveKids = ifelse(haveKids, "Yes", "No")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = educationLevel, y = count, fill = haveKids)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill", stat = "identity") +
  labs(x = "Education Level", y = "Proportion", title = "Proportion of Participants with/without kids by Education Level", fill = "Have kids") +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(percent, 1), "%")), position = position_fill(vjust = 0.5)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#999999", "#78C850"), labels = c("False", "True")) +
  theme_minimal()
  
  absCount / catPercentage
  
```

By visually inspect this diagram, we know that for higher education level such as Bachelors or Graduate, there's fewer people having kids.



Use histogram to visualize the distribution of household sizes:

```{r}
 #library(ggplot2)

  ggplot(Participants, 
       aes(x = age, 
           y = educationLevel,
           fill = stat(x))) +
  geom_density_ridges_gradient(

#### 3.2 About the Financials

Summarize financial data to aggregate spending by categories for the 1 full year, ignore time information.
And sum up different categories to know more about net remaining value after this full year for each participants:

```{r}


  FinancialSumByCategory <- FinancialJournal %>%
  group_by(participantId, category) %>%
  summarise(sum_amount = sum(amount)) %>%
  ungroup()

  FinancialHorizonTable <- FinancialSumByCategory %>%
    spread(category, sum_amount)
  
  
  FinancialHorizonTable$net_remaining <- rowSums(FinancialHorizonTable[,c("Wage", "Shelter", "RentAdjustment", "Recreation", "Food", "Education")], na.rm = TRUE)


  combinedTable <- Participants %>% 
                inner_join(FinancialHorizonTable, by = "participantId")
  
  
  
  view(FinancialHorizonTable)
  view(combinedTable)
```
Now we explore the relationship between joviality and the net remaining money for each individual participants. Scatterplot was selected to check the relationship.

The scatterplot shows the relationship between joviality and net remaining amount for each individual in the dataset, with each point representing a different person. The x-axis shows the joviality score, while the y-axis shows the net remaining amount.

The blue line represents the linear regression fit for each facet. The line gives an indication of the overall trend of the relationship between joviality and net remaining amount within each facet.

```{r}

  library(ggrepel)
  pJov <-  ggplot(data=combinedTable, 
       aes(x= joviality, 
           y=net_remaining,
           color = educationLevel,
           alpha = 0.5)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, 
              size=0.5) +  
  geom_label_repel(aes(label = age), 
                   fontface = "bold", 
                   show.legend = FALSE) +
  ggtitle("Joviality versus net remaining") +
  xlab("Joviality") +
  ylab("Net Remaining Amount") +
  facet_wrap(~haveKids, nrow = 1) # facet by haveKids in one row

  
  pWage <-  ggplot(data=combinedTable, 
       aes(x= joviality, 
           y= Wage,
           color = educationLevel,
           alpha = 0.5)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method=lm, 
              size=0.5) +  
  geom_label_repel(aes(label = age), 
                   fontface = "bold", 
                   show.legend = FALSE) +
  ggtitle("Joviality versus wage") +
  xlab("Joviality") +
  ylab("Wage Amount") +
  facet_wrap(~haveKids, nrow = 1) # facet by haveKids in one row



  ggplotly(pJov)
  ggplotly(pWage)
  
```

From the linear model line plotted above, generally a high wage or a high remaining net amount doesn't guarantee you high Joviality in life. And this trend is the same regardless participants have or do not have kids.

However, interestingly, for HighSchool Or college educational level, with a low wage, if people has kids, their Joviality raised up.
