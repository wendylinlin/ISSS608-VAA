<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="background">1. Background</h2>
<p>City of Engagement, with a <strong>total population of 50,000</strong>, is a <strong>small city</strong> located at Country of Nowhere. The city serves as a <strong>service centre of an agriculture region</strong> surrounding the city. The main agriculture of the region is fruit farms and vineyards. The local council of the city is in the process of preparing the Local Plan 2023. A sample survey of 1000 representative residents had been conducted to collect data <strong>related to their household demographic and spending patterns,</strong> among other things. The city aims to use the data to assist with their major community revitalization efforts, including how to <strong>allocate a very large city renewal grant they have recently received.</strong></p>
<p>Here we will use static and interactive data analytics to help to reveal any data patterns found.</p>

<p>We have 2 data sources: Participants.csv and FinancialJournal.csv and below are what we know about them:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Participants.csv Contains information about the residents of City of Engagement that have agreed to participate in this study.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>participantId (integer): unique ID assigned to each participant.</p></li>
<li><p>householdSize (integer): the number of people in the participant’s household</p></li>
<li><p>haveKids (boolean): whether there are children living in the participant’s household.</p></li>
<li><p>age (integer): participant’s age in years at the start of the study.</p></li>
<li><p>educationLevel (string factor): the participant’s education level, one of: {“Low”, “HighSchoolOrCollege”, “Bachelors”, “Graduate”} <u>(use tidyverse to convert to factor with fix sequence)</u></p></li>
<li><p>interestGroup (char): a char representing the participant’s stated primary interest group, one of {“A”, “B”, “C”, “D”, “E”, “F”, “G”, “H”, “I”, “J”}. Note: specific topics of interest have been redacted to avoid bias.</p></li>
<li><p>joviality (float): a value ranging from [0,1] indicating the participant’s overall happiness level at the start of the study. <strong>0 is very unhappy and 1 is very happy.</strong></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>FinancialJournal.csv Contains information about financial transactions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>participantId (integer): unique ID corresponding to the participant affected</p></li>
<li><p>timestamp (datetime): the time when the check-in was logged.</p></li>
<li><p>category (string factor): a string describing the expense category, one of {“Education”, “Food”, “Recreation”, “RentAdjustment”, “Shelter”, “Wage”}</p></li>
<li><p>amount (double): the amount of the transaction</p></li>
</ul></li>

<p>We first want to understand how is the overall happiness level - Joviality distributed. By plotting Joviality with histogram we know how is the distribution of Joviality spread among the participants. Detailed example for usage of layering concept:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Data</strong>: Use Participant data, focus on Joviality score</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Aesthetics</strong> In terms of Joviality scores, we explore how are people’s joviality level spread between 0 to 1.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Geometrics</strong>: Choose to use histogram, Use 10 bins so the step is 0.1 per bin and we know the count in each value range. To view the count of bin, fill the bins with different gradient of blue based on the count (light blue to dark blue). It is achieved by setting the fill argument to the count variable and using the scale_fill_gradient function to create a gradient color scale.</p>
<ul>
<li>Using labs() function, x and y arguments are used to set the x and y axis labels respectively, title argument is used to set the plot title, and caption argument is used to add the label below the plot to explain value of joviality.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Statistics</strong>, Using stat_bin to allow statistics value of count value to be displayed on top of each bins, so value is visible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Coordinate systems</strong>: Adjusting the display by setting x and y axis range and steps with the Joviality data range and count value range</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Themes</strong>: use theme minimal</p></li>
</ul>

<p>By visually inspect the data, with different categories may have different median value for joviality. By looking at mean/median value together, it looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>people with Graduate education level has highest joviality</li>
<li>Household with size of 3 has highest joviality</li>
<li>People has kids has higher joviality than people without kids</li>
<li>People with interest group ECG has higher joviality than others</li>
</ul>
<p>To test our hypothesis above, we will do some statistical test. The null hypothesis will be the characterists displayed between different sample based on different category is only because of sampling randomness. For hasKids, it’s True or False, we will use T test. For other categorical values such as educationLevel,householdSize,interestGroup, they have 2 or more than 2 categories, we will use ANOVA test. First is to test if</p>
<p>The data doesn’t look as normally distributed based on violin chart, hence we use Kruskal - Wallis test. The Kruskal-Wallis test is a non-parametric test, which does not assume that the data is normally distributed or that the variances are equal. It tests whether there is a significant difference in medians of the groups.</p>

<p>To understand if education level affects having kids, we can perform a chi-squared test for independence. This test will help us determine if there is a significant association between the two categorical variables (education level and have kids). The output of the chi-squared test will give us a p-value. If the p-value is less than the significance level (usually 0.05), we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant association between education level and having kids. The null hypothesis in this test is that the two variables are independent, meaning that there is no association between them. the contingency table shows the frequency count of Participants’ education level and whether they have kids or not. The chi-squared test has been performed to determine whether there is a significant association between education level and having kids.</p>
<p>The result shows that the chi-squared statistic is 12.481 with 3 degrees of freedom, and the p-value is 0.005905. The p-value is less than the conventional alpha level of 0.05, which means that we reject the null hypothesis of independence and conclude that there is a significant association between education level and having kids.</p>
<p>As for the best visualization to plot, we can use a stacked bar chart to show the proportion of participants with and without kids for each education level. Here is an example R code to create a stacked bar chart:</p>
