Exercise Objectives

-   ggstatsplot package to create visual graphics with rich statistical information,

-   performance package to visualise model diagnostics, and

-   parameters package to visualise model parameters

## Basics about Visual Statistical Analysis with **ggstatsplot**

-   [**ggstatsplot**](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/) is an extension of [**ggplot2**](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package for creating graphics with details from statistical tests included in the information-rich plots themselves.

    -   To provide alternative statistical inference methods by default.

    -   To follow best practices for statistical reporting. For all statistical tests reported in the plots, the default template abides by the [APA](https://my.ilstu.edu/~jhkahn/apastats.html) gold standard for statistical reporting. For example, here are results from a robust t-test:

        ## Plotting diagrams

        **ggstatsplot** and **tidyverse** will be used for statistical plots

```{r}
    #| warning: false
pacman::p_load(ggstatsplot,
               tidyverse, PMCMRplus) 
```

Read data here

```{r}
exam <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

### One-sample test with: gghistostats() method

Default information: - statistical details - Bayes Factor - sample sizes - distribution summary

```{r}
set.seed(1234)

gghistostats(
  data = exam,
  x = ENGLISH,
  type = "bayes",
  test.value = 60,
  xlab = "English scores"
)

# We are looking at english, type using bayes factor,there are more types available.
# Test the hypothesis that the value equal to 60
# if we change type to "p", it become parametric test
```

### About the Bayes Factor

A Bayes factor is the ratio of the l**ikelihood of one particular hypothesis to the likelihood of another.** It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.

That's because the Bayes factor gives us **a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so**. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.

When we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), **the Bayes Factor is often written as B10**. It can be defined mathematically as

### How to interpret Bayes Factor

A **Bayes Factor** can be any positive number. Most common interpretation:

### Two-sample mean test: *ggbetweenstats()*

[*ggbetweenstats()*](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/reference/ggbetweenstats.html) is used to **build a visual for two-sample mean test** of Maths scores **by gender**.

```{r}
   #| warning: false
  ggbetweenstats(
    data = exam,
    x = GENDER, 
    y = MATHS,
    type = "np",
    messages = FALSE
  )
```

### Oneway ANOVA Test: *ggbetweenstats()* method

[*ggbetweenstats()*](https://indrajeetpatil.github.io/ggstatsplot/reference/ggbetweenstats.html) is used to build a visual for One-way ANOVA test on English score by race

```{r}
   #| warning: false
   # “ns” → only non-significant
   # “s” → only significant
   # “all” → everything

  ggbetweenstats(
    data = exam,
    x = RACE, 
    y = ENGLISH,
    type = "p",
    mean.ci = TRUE, 
    pairwise.comparisons = TRUE, 
    pairwise.display = "s",
    p.adjust.method = "fdr",
    messages = FALSE
  )
```

### Significant Test of Correlation: ggscatterstats()
 ggscatterstats() is used to build a visual for Significant Test of Correlation between Maths scores and English scores.
```{r}
  ggscatterstats(
  data = exam,
  x = MATHS,
  y = ENGLISH,
  marginal = FALSE,
  )
```

### Significant Test of Association (Depedence) : ggbarstats() methods
 the Maths scores is binned into a 4-class variable by using cut().
 then  ggbarstats() is used to build a visual for Significant Test of Association
```{r}
  exam1 <- exam %>% 
  mutate(MATHS_bins = 
           cut(MATHS, 
               breaks = c(0,60,75,85,100))
  )  
   ggbarstats(exam1, 
     x = MATHS_bins, 
     y = GENDER)

```
