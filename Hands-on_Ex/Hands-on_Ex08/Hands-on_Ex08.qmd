# **Choropleth Mapping with R**

Reference book: https://r4va.netlify.app/chap21.html

Definition: Choropleth mapping involves the symbolisation of enumeration units, such as countries, provinces, states, counties or census units, using area patterns or graduated colors.

Useful packages:

the key R package use is [**tmap**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/) package in R. Beside **tmap** package, four other R packages will be used. They are:

-   [**readr**](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) for importing delimited text file,

-   [**tidyr**](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/) for tidying data,

-   [**dplyr**](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) for wrangling data and

-   [**sf**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/) for handling geospatial data.

-   **readr**, **tidyr** and **dplyr** are part of **tidyverse** package.

### What is tmap? -- Themetic map

-   Tmap can be drawn in both interactive/static mode

-   The syntax is quite similar to ggplot

-   there's different settings and tmap configurations which allow us to put on very rich layers on top: https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap/reference/index.html

```{r loadLibrary}
  pacman::p_load(sf, tmap, tidyverse)
```

## Dataset used

Two data set will be used to create the choropleth map. They are:

-   Master Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary (Web) (i.e. `MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL`) in **ESRI shapefile format.** It can be downloaded at [data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/) This is a **geospatial data**. It consists of the **geographical boundary of Singapore at the planning subzone level**. The data is based on **URA Master Plan 2014.** *(This is the ground fact supporting the geo plot)*

-   Singapore Residents by **Planning Area / Subzone, Age Group, Sex and Type of Dwelling**, June 2011-2020 in csv format (i.e. `respopagesextod2011to2020.csv`). This is an aspatial data fie. It can be downloaded at [Department of Statistics, Singapore](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/) Although it does not contain any coordinates values, but it's PA and SZ fields can be used as unique identifiers to geocode to `MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL` shapefile. *(This is the dataset we wish to plot against the geo data)*

### **Importing Geospatial Data into R**

Below code uses the st_read() function of sf package to import MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL shapefile into R as a simple feature data frame called mapSubzone.

**Most of the sf package, the syntext start with stxxxx**

*Reference:* <https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/st_read.html>

We will need **dsn -- destination**， and define the layer file. So the layer file refer to these examples below:

For shape file we don't need to put the extension, but for any other format we need to put the extension

![](images/tempcapture1.JPG)

```{r loadGeoData}
  mapSubzone <- st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", 
                layer = "MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL")
  mapSubzone
```

sf package will be able to know the format, for example: **SVY21**

#### *How data is stored in the data frame format?*

In Geometry information, each of geometric the information is stored, e.g. the polygon, it's a list of the cordinate pairs

![](images/geometry.JPG)

Your geometry data is always required in any join action. There's attribute in front and geometry is the last column stored as a list

![](images/geo%20column.JPG)

### Importing Attribute Data into R

```{r readAttributeData}
  popdata <- read_csv("data/aspatial/respopagesextod2011to2020.csv")
```

## Data preparation

prepare a data table **with year 2020 values**. The data table should include the variables PA, SZ, YOUNG, ECONOMY ACTIVE, AGED, TOTAL, DEPENDENCY.

-   YOUNG: age group 0 to 4 until age groyup 20 to 24,

-   ECONOMY ACTIVE: age group 25-29 until age group 60-64,

-   AGED: age group 65 and above,

-   TOTAL: all age group,

-   DEPENDENCY: the ratio between young and aged against economy active group

## Data wrangling (Important)

The following data wrangling and transformation functions will be used:

**pivot_wider**() of tidyr package, and mutate(), filter(), group_by() and select() of dplyr package

-   **pivot_wider**() - this pivot the table with age and different population

-   Use mutate to calculate population around different age group and give them label

```{r dataWrangling}
popdata2020 <- popdata %>%
  filter(Time == 2020) %>%
  group_by(PA, SZ, AG) %>%
  summarise(`POP` = sum(`Pop`)) %>%
  ungroup()%>%
  pivot_wider(names_from=AG, 
              values_from=POP) %>%  # this is to split the AG column with the value of POP, it's easier to do the summartion
  mutate(YOUNG = rowSums(.[3:6]) 
         +rowSums(.[12])) %>%   #column 3 - column 6 are consider young, and column 12 also under young age group. This is sum according to the row so use row sum here.
  mutate(`ECONOMY ACTIVE` = rowSums(.[7:11])+
  rowSums(.[13:15]))%>%
  mutate(`AGED`=rowSums(.[16:21])) %>%
  mutate(`TOTAL`=rowSums(.[3:21])) %>%  
  mutate(`DEPENDENCY` = (`YOUNG` + `AGED`)
  /`ECONOMY ACTIVE`) %>%
    select(`PA`, `SZ`, `YOUNG`, 
         `ECONOMY ACTIVE`, `AGED`, 
         `TOTAL`, `DEPENDENCY`)  #selection used to select the column we want + re-organize the data we want

```

#### Joining the attribute data and geospatial data

Before we can perform the georelational join, one extra step is required to **convert the values in PA and SZ fields to uppercase.** This is because the **values of PA and SZ fields are made up of upper- and lowercase**. On the other, and the SUBZONE_N and PLN_AREA_N are in uppercase. （**Before we join the table, the cases need to be the same so values can match）**

left_join() of dplyr is used to join the geographical data and attribute table using planning subzone name e.g. \*\* SUBZONE_N and SZ as the common identifier. \*\*

```{r convert and Join}
  popdata2020 <- popdata2020 %>%
  mutate_at(.vars = vars(PA, SZ), 
          .funs = funs(toupper)) %>%  #use R function .funs(toupper) to conver the texts to upper case
  filter(`ECONOMY ACTIVE` > 0)

   mpsz_pop2020 <- left_join(mapSubzone, popdata2020,
                          by = c("SUBZONE_N" = "SZ"))
```

After we join the table, we need to check again **if the attributes are inserted in the middle columns and the last column should be geometry column.**

left_join() of dplyr package is used with mpsz simple feature data frame as the left data table is to ensure that the output will be a simple features data frame.

We then save the dataset to mpszpop2020.rds

```{r saveValue}
  write_rds(mpsz_pop2020, "data/rds/mpszpop2020.rds")
```

# **Choropleth Mapping Geospatial Data Using *tmap***

Two approaches can be used to prepare thematic map using *tmap*, they are:

-   Plotting a **thematic map quickly by using *qtm()*.**

-   Plotting **highly customisable thematic map by using tmap** elements.

## Cartographic standard choropleth map 

```{r simpleQTM}
  tmap_mode("plot")
  qtm(mpsz_pop2020, 
    fill = "DEPENDENCY")
```

Things to learn from the code chunk above:

-   *tmap_mode()* with "plot" option is **used to produce a static map**. For **interactive mode, "view" option should be used**.

-   ***fill*** **argument is used to map the attribute** (i.e. DEPENDENCY)

## Customize choropleth map by using tmap's elements

Despite its usefulness of drawing a choropleth map quickly and easily, the disadvantge of qtm() is that it makes aesthetics of individual layers harder to control. **To draw a high quality cartographic choropleth map as shown in the figure below, tmap's drawing elements should be used.**

Tmap works similar to ggplot2

-   1st layer is sf geo data to put inside tm_shape

-   tm_fill is the container for tmap to create the polygon layer

    -   use tm_symbols/tm_squares()/tm_bubbles() etc we will be able to draw symbols

```{r customizeMap}
  tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+
  tm_fill("DEPENDENCY", 
          style = "quantile",   # this is the classification method
          palette = "Blues",    #this is the colorbrewer color palette
          title = "Dependency ratio") +   #this is the legend's title
  tm_layout(main.title = "Distribution of Dependency Ratio by planning subzone",   #this is the overall diagram title
            main.title.position = "center",
            main.title.size = 1.2,
            legend.height = 0.45,  #this is for legend setting
            legend.width = 0.35,   #this is the legend width
            frame = TRUE) +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +  #this is the polygon border
  tm_compass(type="8star", size = 2) +  #this is the star shape compass, there are other choise such as radar, rose, arrow, 4star etc
  tm_scale_bar() +
  tm_grid(alpha =0.2) + #this is the grid line
  tm_credits("Source: Planning Sub-zone boundary from Urban Redevelopment Authorithy (URA)\n and Population data from Department of Statistics DOS", 
             position = c("left", "bottom"))  #this is the citation below the map
```

### Breaking down of customize map steps

1.  Drawing a base map The basic building block of tmap is tm_shape() followed by one or more layer elemments such as tm_fill() and tm_polygons().

In the code chunk below, tm_shape() is used to define the input data (i.e mpsz_pop2020) and tm_polygons() is used to draw the planning subzone polygons

```{r polygons}
  tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +
  tm_polygons()
```

2.  Drawing a choropleth map using tm_polygons()

To draw a choropleth map showing the geographical distribution of a selected variable by planning subzone, we just need to assign the target variable such as Dependency to tm_polygons().

```{r choroplethPolygons}
  tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+
  tm_polygons("DEPENDENCY")
```

-   The default interval binning used to draw the choropleth map is called "pretty".

    -   A detailed discussion of the data classification methods supported by tmap can be see in below section.

-   The default colour scheme used is YlOrRd of ColorBrewer.

    -   By default, Missing value will be shaded in grey.

### Drawing a choropleth map using tm_fill() and \*tm_border()\*\*

Actually, **tm_polygons() is a wraper of tm_fill() and tm_border().**

tm_fill() shades the polygons by using the default colour scheme and tm_borders() adds the borders of the shapefile onto the choropleth map.

If we draws a choropleth map by using tm_fill() alone:

```{r fillOnly}
  tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+ tm_fill("DEPENDENCY")
```

Notice that the planning subzones are shared according to the respective dependecy values

To add the boundary of the planning subzones, tm_borders will be used as shown in the code chunk below.

```{r addBorder}
  tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+
  tm_fill("DEPENDENCY") +
  tm_borders(lwd = 0.1,  alpha = 1)  #lwd - line width control
```

Notice that light-gray border lines have been added on the choropleth map.

The alpha argument is used to define transparency number between 0 (totally transparent) and 1 (not transparent). By default, the alpha value of the col is used (normally 1).

Beside alpha argument, there are three other arguments for tm_borders(), they are:

-   col = border colour,

-   lwd = border line width. The default is 1,

-   lty = border line type. The default is "solid".

### Data classification methods of tmap

Most choropleth maps employ some methods of data classification. The point of classification is to take a large number of observations and group them into data ranges or classes.

**tmap** provides a total ten data classification methods, namely: ***fixed*****, *sd*, *equal*, *pretty* (default), *quantile*, *kmeans*, *hclust*, *bclust*, *fisher*, and *jenks*.**

To define a data classification method, the *style* argument of *tm_fill()* or *tm_polygons()* will be used.

#### Plotting choropleth maps with built-in classification methods

The code chunk below shows a quantile data classification that used 5 classes.

```{r defaultClassification}
  tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+
  tm_fill("DEPENDENCY",
  n = 5,
  style = "jenks") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)

  tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+
  tm_fill("DEPENDENCY",
          n = 5,
          style = "equal") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)
```

#### ??DIY?? Explore other classifications

```{r usekmeansMethod}
  tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+
  tm_fill("DEPENDENCY",
          n = 5,
          style = "kmeans") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)
```

```{r usehclustMethod}
  tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+
  tm_fill("DEPENDENCY",
          n = 5,
          style = "hclust") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)
```

```{r diffNumOfClass}
  tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+
  tm_fill("DEPENDENCY",
          n = 2,
          style = "equal") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)


  tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+
    tm_fill("DEPENDENCY",
            n = 6,
            style = "equal") +
    tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)
  
  tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+
    tm_fill("DEPENDENCY",
            n = 10,
            style = "equal") +
    tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)
  
  tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+
    tm_fill("DEPENDENCY",
            n = 20,
            style = "equal") +
    tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)
```

#### Plotting choropleth map with custome break

For all the built-in styles, the category breaks are computed internally. **In order to override these defaults, the breakpoints can be set explicitly by means of the *breaks* argument to the *tm_fill()*.** It is important to note that, in **tmap** the breaks include a minimum and maximum. As a result, in order to end up with **n categories, n+1 elements must be specified in the *breaks* option** (the values must be in increasing order).

We need to **get some descriptive statistics on the variable** before setting the break points. Code chunk below will be used to compute and display the descriptive statistics of **DEPENDENCY** field.

```{r dependencyStat}
  summary(mpsz_pop2020$DEPENDENCY)
```

With reference to the results above, we set break point at 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, and 0.90. In addition, we also need to include a minimum and maximum, which we set at 0 and 100. Our breaks vector is thus c(0, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 1.00)

```{r }
  tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+
  tm_fill("DEPENDENCY",
          breaks = c(0, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 1.00)) +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)
  
```

### **Colour Scheme**

**tmap** supports colour ramps either defined by the user or a set of predefined colour ramps from the **RColorBrewer** package

#### Using ColourBrewer palette

```{r tryingDifferentColors}

  tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+
  tm_fill("DEPENDENCY",
          n = 6,
          style = "quantile",
          palette = "Blues") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)

  tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+
  tm_fill("DEPENDENCY",
          n = 6,
          style = "quantile",
           palette = "Greens") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)

  #we can reverse the color scale by putting a - infront of "greens"
  
  tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+
  tm_fill("DEPENDENCY",
          style = "quantile",
          palette = "-Greens") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)
  
```

### **Map Layouts**

Map layout **refers to the combination of all map elements** into a cohensive map. Map elements include among others the objects to be mapped, **the title, the scale bar, the compass, margins and aspects ratios.**

#### Map Legend

In **tmap**, several *legend* options are provided to change the placement, format and appearance of the legend.

```{r legendChanges}
  tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+
  tm_fill("DEPENDENCY", 
          style = "jenks", 
          palette = "Blues", 
          legend.hist = TRUE,  #add in the data histogram here
          legend.is.portrait = TRUE, 
          legend.hist.z = 0.1) + #histogram follows classification scheme
  tm_layout(main.title = "Distribution of Dependency Ratio by planning subzone \n(Jenks classification)",
            main.title.position = "center",
            main.title.size = 1,
            legend.height = 0.45, 
            legend.width = 0.35,
            legend.outside = FALSE,
            legend.position = c("right", "bottom"),
            frame = FALSE) +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tmap_style("white")  #this is to reset the map style to default

```

#### Map style

tmap allows a wide **variety of layout settings to be changed**. They can be called by using tmap_style().

The code chunk below **shows the classic style** is used.

```{r mapStyleChanges}
  tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+
  tm_fill("DEPENDENCY", 
          style = "quantile", 
          palette = "-Greens") +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tmap_style("classic")

```

#### Cartographic Furniture

**tmap** also also provides arguments to draw other map furniture such as compass, scale bar and grid lines.

*Code below shows tm_compass()*, *tm_scale_bar()* and *tm_grid()* are used to add compass, scale bar and grid lines onto the choropleth map.

```{r addallFurniture}
  tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+
  tm_fill("DEPENDENCY", 
          style = "quantile", 
          palette = "Blues",
          title = "No. of persons") +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Distribution of Dependency Ratio \nby planning subzone",
            main.title.position = "center",
            main.title.size = 1.2,
            legend.height = 0.45, 
            legend.width = 0.35,
            frame = TRUE) +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tm_compass(type="8star", size = 2) +
  tm_scale_bar(width = 0.15) +
  tm_grid(lwd = 0.1, alpha = 0.2) +
  tm_credits("Source: Planning Sub-zone boundary from Urban Redevelopment Authorithy (URA)\n and Population data from Department of Statistics DOS", 
             position = c("left", "bottom"))
```

### **Drawing Small Multiple Choropleth Maps**

#### Creating with facet

**Similar to GGPLOT, for Small multiple maps**, also referred to as **facet maps**, are composed of many maps arrange **side-by-side**, and sometimes stacked vertically. Small multiple maps enable the visualisation of how spatial relationships change with respect to another variable, such as time.

In **tmap**, small multiple maps can be plotted in three ways:

-   by assigning multiple values to at least one of the asthetic arguments,

-   by defining a group-by variable in *tm_facets()*, and

-   by creating multiple stand-alone maps with *tmap_arrange()*.

#### Organize by assigning multiple values to at least one of the aesthetic arguments

small multiple choropleth maps are created by defining ***ncols*** in **tm_fill(), based on Young and Old**

```{r facetWithAttribute}
  tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+
  tm_fill(c("YOUNG", "AGED"),
          style = "equal", 
          palette = "Blues") +
  tm_layout(legend.position = c("right", "bottom")) +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5) +
  tmap_style("white")
```

```{r diffColorForDiffAttribute}
  tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+ 
  tm_polygons(c("DEPENDENCY","AGED"),
          style = c("equal", "quantile"), 
          palette = list("Blues","Greens")) +
  tm_layout(legend.position = c("right", "bottom"))
```

#### By defining a group-by variable in tm_facets()

If we want the map to fix the respective areas insteaad of always the default map, use this instead:

```{r respectiveAreaPlot}
  tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +
  tm_fill("DEPENDENCY",
          style = "quantile",
          palette = "Blues",
          thres.poly = 0) + 
  tm_facets(by="REGION_N", 
            free.coords=TRUE,   #this is how you free the map region, if we change to FALSE, the map will have empty space in between
            drop.shapes=TRUE) +   #When this is true, the outter shape will not appear
  tm_layout(legend.show = FALSE,
            title.position = c("center", "center"), 
            title.size = 20) +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)
```

#### By creating multiple stand-alone maps with tmap_arrange()

multiple small choropleth maps are created by creating multiple stand-alone maps with tmap_arrange().
```{r }
  youngmap <- tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+ 
  tm_polygons("YOUNG", 
              style = "quantile", 
              palette = "Blues")

agedmap <- tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+ 
  tm_polygons("AGED", 
              style = "quantile", 
              palette = "Blues")

tmap_arrange(youngmap, agedmap, asp=1, ncol=2)
```


### Mappping Spatial Object Meeting a Selection Criterion

Instead of creating small multiple choropleth map, you can also **use selection funtion to map spatial objects meeting the selection criterion**.

```{r selectedRegionOnly}
  tm_shape(mpsz_pop2020[mpsz_pop2020$REGION_N=="CENTRAL REGION", ])+
  tm_fill("DEPENDENCY", 
          style = "quantile", 
          palette = "Blues", 
          legend.hist = TRUE, 
          legend.is.portrait = TRUE,
          legend.hist.z = 0.1) +
  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE,
            legend.height = 0.45, 
            legend.width = 5.0,
            legend.position = c("right", "bottom"),
            frame = FALSE) +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)
```
