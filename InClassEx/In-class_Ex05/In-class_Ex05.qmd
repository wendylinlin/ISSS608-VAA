1.  Preparing with Graph Data 1.1 Data source checking and organization

You should always have source and target in the data file, shift and put them as the first 2 columns, source first, target second. ![](Source%20Destination.JPG){width="463"}

1.2

We need a node mapping file, the ID must be the same as the source and target from the first file. And for the label, it's there which map the exact label of the nodes to shorten it in case it's required. Remember to to input all data value, such as ("No data", "unknown" etc to replace the empty value there.) ![](Labeling%20of%20source%20and%20target.JPG)

2.  Import data

```{r loadlibrary}
    #| warning: false
    #| echo: false
  pacman::p_load(tidyverse,dplyr, ggplot2) 
```

```{r loaddata}
  #| warning: false
  #| echo: false
  GAStech_nodes <- read_csv("data/GAStech_email_node.csv")
  GAStech_edges <- read_csv("data/GAStech_email_edge-v2.csv")
```

Check through data, there's format issue. Conver the format:

```{r convert format}
  GAStech_edges <- GAStech_edges %>%
  mutate(SendDate = dmy(SentDate)) %>%
  mutate(Weekday = wday(SentDate,
                        label = TRUE,
                        abbr = FALSE))
```

# Problem Statement

Seafood is a highly traded commodity globally, with **over a third** of the world's population relying on it as a primary source of protein. However, illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing practices have led to **overfishing and pose significant threats to marine ecosystems, food security** **in coastal communities, and regional stability.** These activities are associated with organized crime and human rights violations.

FishEye International, a nonpartisan NGO, aims to understand the factors driving illegal fishing. They have collected data over the years to gain insights into this issue. FishEye International is getting help to **assist them in interpreting the conflicting data** and eventually making recommendations on how to address illegal fishing and its broader impacts.

## Goal of this file: Contextualize Data

FishEye has collects online news articles about fishing, marine industry, and international maritime trade. To facilitate their analysis, FishEye uses a natural language processing tool to **extract the names of entities (people and businesses) and the relationships between them.** We will focus on the following 4 entities:

**Entities to investigate**

1.  Mar de la Vida OJSC

2.  979893388

3.  Oceanfront Oasis Inc Carrie

4.  8327

## Data Preprocessing

Load the library and read the json relationship file MC1.

```{r loadData}
  #Load Libraries
  pacman::p_load(jsonlite,tidygraph, ggraph, visNetwork, tidyverse)

  #load Data
  #If we already have jsonlite, we don't need it anymore
  MC1<- jsonlite::fromJSON("data/MC1.json")
```

After checking MC1, the data is a found to be in a list and it's not stored in proper structure in R for Graph objects, such as igraph, tidygraph etc. We need to pull out the nodes and links out from the MC1 and **store them in R Graph Objects.**

By visual inspection of raw data, MC1 Nodes and Links both contain "dataset" column with only "MC1" as value, they can be eliminated.

We picked the desired fields and reorganized the columns **using select function.**

```{r }
  MC1_nodes <- as.tibble(MC1$nodes) %>% 
  select(id, type, country) 

  MC1_edges <- as.tibble(MC1$links) %>% 
  select (source, target, type, weight, key)
  
```

```{r}
  MC2<- fromJSON("data/mc2_challenge_graph.json")
```

### Cleaning data for nodes

```{r inspectNodeData}
  #| code-fold: true
  #| code-summary: "Show code"
 
    #to check data table
    head(MC1_nodes, n = 30)

    # Check summary statistics of the data
    summary(MC1_nodes)
    
    # Count the number of unique IDs
    unique_id_count <- MC1_nodes %>%
    distinct(id) %>%
    nrow()
    unique_id_count # this is 3417 smaller than 3428, it means there are duplicate fields to remove
    
    
    # Count the number of non-NA values in each column
    colSums(is.na(MC1_nodes))
    
    # Check unique values in the "type" column
    unique(MC1_nodes$type)

    # Check unique values in the "country" column
    length(unique(MC1_nodes$country))
    
```

[**Issues found:**]{.underline}

1.  The unique_id_count (3417) is smaller than total row count (3428), and different from 3721 nodes as specified in Data notes. Hence, there are duplicate ids in the dataset. We will **need to remove duplicate id**.
2.  There's **no NA row for ids**, however **for country or for type, there are NA values.** And in some cases there's only id and **both country and type value are missing**. We will remove these data as a id value itself alone doesn't provide much information.
3.  There are at least **118 distinct countries possible**, however the country values are not in the same format. Some are fictitious name such as "Nalakond, Rio Isla" which can't be found in real world, while the rest of them is a country with sequence number such as "Country_271835".
4.  In this study, we want to focus on **names of entities (people and businesses) and the relationships between them**, so for other type we may remove them.

### Cleaning data for edges

```{r inspectEdgeData}
  #| code-fold: true
  #| code-summary: "Show code"
 
    #to check data table
    head(MC1_edges, n = 30)

    # Check summary statistics of the data
    summary(MC1_edges)
    
    #To find duplicate rows in the MC1_edges data frame based on the "source" and "target" and "type" columns
    #the subset() function is used to select only the "source" and "target" columns from MC1_edges. The duplicated() function is then applied to identify rows with duplicated combinations of "source" and "target". By using the | (OR) operator with duplicated(subset(...)) and duplicated(subset(...), fromLast = TRUE), it finds both the first occurrence and the last occurrence of the duplicated rows.

    duplicate_rows <- MC1_edges %>%
    filter(duplicated(subset(., select = c("source", "target", "type" ))) |
           duplicated(subset(., select = c("source", "target" , "type")), fromLast = TRUE))
    
    # check if there are any NA values in each column
    colSums(is.na(MC1_edges))
    
    unique(MC1_edges$key)
    
    unique(MC1_edges$type)

 
    
```

In edge dataset, no NA rows for each of the column. For duplicates, though the rest of the values are the same, but their key and weight are different.

### Handling missing values and not useful value

By checking MC1_nodes, quite a number of rows only have id, there's no type and country information. Delete these type of nodes as they do not add value to the analysis.

```{r missingvalue}
  #| code-fold: true
  #| code-summary: "Show code"
 
  # only keep distinct idS
  # Filter out rows with NA values in both country and type columns
  MC1_nodes_unique<- MC1_nodes %>%
  distinct(id, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  filter(!is.na(country) | !is.na(type))

  # further filter to remove the rows in MC1_nodes_unique where the type column is either "movement" or "event"
  MC1_nodes_cleaned <- MC1_nodes_unique %>%
  filter(!type %in% c("movement", "event"))

```

After filtering, only 2721 entries left in MC1_nodes_cleaned to be used in the analytics.

### Data consistency in entity names and relationships

Here we need to remove rows in edge, where either source or target id is not found in nodes. Nodes id should be the Primary Key for all source/target entries in Edge, **filtering is required in edge dataset to only keep source/target** with the ids appeared in node dataset.

```{r consistency}
  #| code-fold: true
  #| code-summary: "Show code"
 
  MC1_edges_cleaned <- MC1_edges %>%
  filter(source %in% MC1_nodes_cleaned$id, target %in% MC1_nodes_cleaned$id)
  
  #Review the clearned data:
  glimpse(MC1_edges_cleaned)
  glimpse(MC1_nodes_cleaned)


```

The number of rows reduce from 11069 to 6490 after filtering.

## Entity Visualization

### create The **tbl_graph** object

Using tidygraph package, we will build tidygraph network graph data.frame. The graph is directed with source and target specificed.

(Planning: Display entities relationship as we focused (graph network))

```{r graphobject}
peopleEntityRelationship <- tbl_graph(nodes = MC1_nodes_cleaned,
                           edges = MC1_edges_cleaned,
                           directed = TRUE)

  peopleEntityRelationship
  
  peopleEntityRelationship %>%
  activate(edges) %>%
  arrange(desc(weight))
```

## Interactive Exploration

(Planning: Interactive Exploration: Develop an interactive interface that allows analysts to explore the entities and their context dynamically. Enable functionalities like filtering, highlighting, and zooming to focus on specific entities or connections of interest. This interactive approach will help analysts identify patterns, anomalies, and potential links to illegal fishing more efficiently.)

```{r}
  # ggraph(peopleEntityRelationship, layout="sparse") +  #
  # geom_edge_link() +
  # geom_node_point()
```
