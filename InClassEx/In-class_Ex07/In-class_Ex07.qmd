### Import data by read csv

```{r loadData}
  averp <- read_csv("data/AVERP.csv") 
  #do the date manipulation, original date field read in is char field, it's not properly recognized as date. Do a convertion with dd-mm-yy conversion
  #this is leverage on lubridate R page
  averp <- averp%>%
  mutate(`Date` = dmy(`Date`))
```

### **Plotting the horizon graph**

To handle the time series display with geom horizon:

```{r horizon}
  #horizon graph is controlled by geom_horizon
  
  averp %>% 
  filter(Date >= "2018-01-01") %>%   #select the date range here
  ggplot() +                         # this shows horizon is an extension of ggplot, we want horizon plot, it will be based on ggplot
  geom_horizon(aes(x = Date, y=Values),   #our x are the dates, where y are the absolute value
               origin = "midpoint", 
               horizonscale = 6)+
  facet_grid(`Consumer Items`~.) +   #we use facet to show different consumer items, the `consumer items` is to let system recognize when there's a space in between. ~. 
    theme_few() +
  scale_fill_hcl(palette = 'RdBu') +  #this is red to blue color scheme, the below part is optional
  theme(panel.spacing.y=unit(0, "lines"), strip.text.y = element_text(
    size = 5, angle = 0, hjust = 0),   #trial and error for this number to fix the text in
    legend.position = 'none',
    axis.text.y = element_blank(),
    # axis.text.x = element_text(size=7),
    # axis.title.y = element_blank(),
    # axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    # axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
    # panel.border = element_blank()
    ) +
    scale_x_date(expand=c(0,0), date_breaks = "3 month", date_labels = "%b%y") +
  ggtitle('Average Retail Prices of Selected Consumer Items (Jan 2018 to Dec 2022)')
```
